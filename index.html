      <h3>About Matt</h3>
        <p>I had been working in healthcare since 2012, both as an employee and a consultant. Helping other recieve the medical care they desperately need is still something I'm passionate about and it's my hope to eventually fuse my previous career with my new love of software engineering.</p>

        <p>Enrolling in the prepcourse at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/web-development/">Thinkful</a> has sparked a passion that I did not know existed. I'm super excited to start on my new career path and working with other developers!</p>

        <p>I love learning from and working with other software engineers. If you're looking for a new developer, please reach out! I'd love to talk.</p>
